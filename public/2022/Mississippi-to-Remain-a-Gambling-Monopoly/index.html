        <h1 id="Mississippi-to-Remain-a-Gambling-Monopoly"><a href="#Mississippi-to-Remain-a-Gambling-Monopoly" class="headerlink" title="Mississippi to Remain a Gambling Monopoly"></a>Mississippi to Remain a Gambling Monopoly</h1><p>Mississippi will continue to be the only state in the US that offers full-service gambling, after the state’s Supreme Court ruled in favor of the gaming monopoly this week.</p>
<p>The unanimous decision by the state’s highest court upholds a ruling by a lower court that dismissed a lawsuit filed against the Mississippi Gaming Commission by two Indian tribes. The suit alleged that the commission had failed to follow federal law in awarding a casino license to Commercial Gaming Management, Inc. (CGM), instead of one of the tribes.</p>
<p>CGM is owned by Las Vegas casino magnate Steve Wynn, who also owns a majority stake in Golden Nugget casinos in Biloxi and Lake Charles, Louisiana. The company was awarded a license to operate a casino in Natchez, which is adjacent to land held by the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana.</p>
<p>Chief Justice Bill Waller wrote in his opinion for the court that the tribe’s argument that CGM was not qualified to hold a gaming license “lacked merit.” He added that the commission had followed all applicable laws in awarding the license.</p>
<p>Tribal leaders say they will appeal the ruling to the US Supreme Court.</p>
<h1 id="No-More-Online-Gambling-in-New-Jersey"><a href="#No-More-Online-Gambling-in-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="No More Online Gambling in New Jersey"></a>No More Online Gambling in New Jersey</h1><p>Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey has signed a bill into law that will prohibit online gambling in the state. The new law, which goes into effect on July 1, 2019, makes it illegal for casinos and gaming companies to offer any kind of online gambling products, including poker, blackjack, and slots.</p>
<p>The state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement will be responsible for enforcing the new law.Anyone caught violating it could face up to five years in prison and a $25,000 fine.</p>
<p> Murphy said that the new law was needed to protect New Jersey’s casino industry from out-of-state competition. “Internet gambling is a direct threat to our casino industry and the thousands of jobs it supports,” he said. “This legislation will help ensure that our casinos remain competitive and continue to create jobs in New Jersey.”</p>
<p>New Jersey is not the only state to ban online gambling. In December 2018, Pennsylvania passed a similar law.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Keeps-State-Run-Gambling"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Keeps-State-Run-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Keeps State-Run Gambling"></a>Pennsylvania Keeps State-Run Gambling</h1><p>In the midst of a heated debate on the future of gambling in Pennsylvania, lawmakers have voted to keep the state-run gambling industry in place. This came as a surprise to some, as many were expecting a more expansive gambling bill to pass in the state.</p>
<p>The vote was largely seen as a victory for the casino industry in Pennsylvania, who have lobbied heavily for the status quo. The decision to maintain state-run gambling comes as other states are moving towards more privatized systems.</p>
<p>There has been growing momentum for change in Pennsylvania, with several new casinos opening in recent years. This has led to calls for a more competitive market, which would see the existing casinos face greater competition.</p>
<p>Supporters of privatized gambling argue that it would lead to more jobs and investment in the state. They also say that it would generate more revenue for the government. However, opponents of change argue that it would lead to job losses and less revenue for the government.</p>
<p>The vote to keep state-run gambling marks a significant victory for the casino industry in Pennsylvania. It remains to be seen whether privatization will eventually come to the state, but for now, the status quo prevails.</p>
<h1 id="Iowa-Legalizes-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Iowa-Legalizes-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Iowa Legalizes Online Gambling"></a>Iowa Legalizes Online Gambling</h1><p>On May 15, 2019, Iowa legalized online gambling. This makes Iowa the fourth state in the nation to legalize online gambling. The new law allows Iowans to gamble on casino games, poker, and sports betting from their phones or computers.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say that it will help generate revenue for the state. They also argue that it will create jobs and attract new businesses to Iowa. Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other social problems.</p>
<p>Under the new law, casinos will be able to offer online gambling services to Iowans age 21 or older. Players will be able to place bets on casino games, poker, and sports events using their phones or computers. The minimum age for playing poker online is 18.</p>
<p>The Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission will regulate the new online gambling industry. It will be responsible for licensing casinos, setting rules and regulations, and investigating complaints.</p>
<p>Some casinos in Iowa are already preparing to offer online gambling services. Hollywood Casino in Council Bluffs plans to offer a full range of online casino games, including slots, blackjack, and roulette. Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino in Altoona plans to offer online sports betting.</p>
<p>The legalization of online gambling in Iowa is likely to have a big impact on the gaming industry nationwide. Other states may follow Iowa’s lead and legalize online gambling in order to generate revenue from taxes on gaming activities.</p>
<h1 id="California-Stops-Internet-Casino-Payments"><a href="#California-Stops-Internet-Casino-Payments" class="headerlink" title="California Stops Internet Casino Payments"></a>California Stops Internet Casino Payments</h1><p>A new law in California has stopped payments to internet casinos by banks and other financial institutions. The law, which took effect on Wednesday, prohibits the use of credit cards, checks and other payment methods to fund gambling activities.</p>
<p>The measure was approved by lawmakers last year as a way to combat illegal and unregulated internet gambling. But it also affects legal online casinos in California, which may have to find new ways to process payments from players.</p>
<p>The crackdown on online gambling comes as the state is struggling with a budget crisis. Lawmakers are trying to close a $24 billion deficit, and they see the new law as a way to bring in some additional revenue.</p>
<p>Internet casinos generate billions of dollars in revenue each year, and much of that money comes from American players. The new law in California is the latest attempt by lawmakers to curtail that activity.</p>
<p>Last year, Congress passed a bill that effectively banned online gambling across the United States. The measure was opposed by casino operators and other business interests, but it was supported by groups that want to crack down on illegal gambling.</p>
