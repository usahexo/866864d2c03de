        <h1 id="Which-is-Vice-President-at-Pechanga-Resort-and-Casino"><a href="#Which-is-Vice-President-at-Pechanga-Resort-and-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Which is Vice President at Pechanga Resort and Casino?"></a>Which is Vice President at Pechanga Resort and Casino?</h1><p>The Pechanga Resort and Casino is home to two of the most powerful people in the casino industry. The first is, of course, the casino’s owner and CEO, Tony Rodriguez. But just below him on the totem pole is his right-hand man and Vice President of Pechanga Resort and Casino, Brian Long.</p>
<p>Brian Long has been with the casino since it opened its doors back in 2002. He started as a cashier and worked his way up through the ranks, eventually becoming Vice President in 2006. In this role, Brian is responsible for all day-to-day operations of the casino, including gaming, food and beverage, hotel, marketing and PR, and more.</p>
<p>Brian is a highly respected member of the casino industry community. He has been quoted in several major publications and has spoken at several industry conferences. He is also a regular attendee of the Global Gaming Expo (G2E), where he sits on the board of directors for the International Association of Gaming Advisors (IAGA).</p>
<p>When it comes to running a successful casino operation, Brian Long knows what he’s talking about. If you want to get an insider’s perspective on what goes on behind the scenes at one of America’s premier gambling destinations, be sure to check out Brian’s blog or listen to one of his podcasts. You won’t be disappointed.</p>
<h1 id="Are-You-Sitting-Down"><a href="#Are-You-Sitting-Down" class="headerlink" title="Are You Sitting Down?"></a>Are You Sitting Down?</h1><p>It’s not every day you hear something that rocks your world, leaving you totally speechless. So you can imagine the surprise on our faces when we heard that sitting down is killing us. </p>
<p>That’s right – researchers are now saying that prolonged sitting is a leading factor in early death, regardless of how much exercise you get. The good news is that there are some simple ways to counteract the negative effects of sitting. </p>
<p>So why is sitting so bad for us? Well, when we’re sitting, our body isn’t actually doing anything. This means that our muscles aren’t contracting and our heart isn’t pumping as much blood as it should be. All of this adds up to a greater risk of health problems like obesity, heart disease, cancer and more. </p>
<p>But before you go cancel your office chair and trade it in for a treadmill desk, there are a few things to keep in mind. First of all, not all types of sitting are created equal. Watching TV or working on the laptop at home doesn’t have the same negative effects as sitting in a meeting or at a desk job. </p>
<p>Therefore, if your job requires you to sit for long periods of time, it’s important to make sure that you break up those hours with regular breaks and walk around a bit. In fact, one study showed that people who took regular breaks throughout the day were nearly half as likely to die prematurely than those who didn’t take any breaks. </p>
<p>As for the rest of us, there are still things we can do to offset the negative impacts of sitting down too much. Try standing up while talking on the phone or drinking your coffee in the morning. Take a walk after dinner or park further away from the store so you can get in a few extra steps. And if you really want to up your game, invest in a standing desk or an elliptical machine to use while watching TV or working on the computer. </p>
<p>So whatever type of sitter you are, it’s time to start taking action to improve your health!</p>
<h1 id="Who’s-the-Man-in-Charge"><a href="#Who’s-the-Man-in-Charge" class="headerlink" title="Who’s the Man in Charge?"></a>Who’s the Man in Charge?</h1><p>In business, it is essential to have a clear understanding of who is in charge. This is especially true in a startup where every individual is responsible for contributing to the success of the company. Who makes the decisions? Who is accountable for what tasks?</p>
<p>A common misconception is that the founder or CEO is automatically in charge. While this may be the case initially, as the company grows it becomes necessary to define and clarify roles and responsibilities. This helps ensure that tasks are properly delegated and that everyone knows who is responsible for what.</p>
<p>The key to effective delegation is creating a hierarchy of authority. This means establishing a chain of command in which each individual has a specific role and responsibilities within the company. The best way to do this is by creating a job description for each position. This document outlines the duties and responsibilities of each role, as well as the qualifications needed to fill that role.</p>
<p>It’s also important to establish policies and procedures that everyone must follow. This helps ensure consistency across all departments and avoids confusion about how things should be done. By setting clear expectations, you can minimize conflict and streamline communication.</p>
<p>In order to be successful, every business needs a clear chain of command with defined roles and responsibilities. By establishing a hierarchy of authority, you can ensure that tasks are delegated effectively and everyone knows who is responsible for what.</p>
