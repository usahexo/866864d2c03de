#  Person Who Works Gambling Ring May Be Sentenced To 10 Years In Prison

A person who works for a gambling ring may be sentenced to 10 years in prison. The person pleaded guilty to money laundering and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. 

The ring was based in Los Angeles and operated between 2011 and 2016. It laundered more than $50 million in illegal gambling profits, according to prosecutors. 

The ringleader, who has not been identified, is still at large.

#  Woman Faces Up To 5 Years In Prison For Running Gambling Ring

42-year-old woman faces five years in prison for running an illegal gambling ring on the side. Prosecutors say that she took in over $720,000 in revenue from her gambling ring between September of 2016 and April of 2019. In addition to the prison sentence, she also faces a $250,000 fine.

Her attorney is arguing that she should receive a reduced sentence due to her cooperation with authorities. She has already given up the names of other people involved in the ring and has promised to continue to cooperate. She has also agreed to forfeit any assets related to the gambling activity.

Prosecutors say that the woman ran two different gambling operations out of her home. One was a traditional poker game, while the other was an online gaming site. The online gaming site was specifically targeted at Chinese nationals living in the United States, and it took in over $500,000 in revenue.

The woman’s defense team plans to argue that she should not be held responsible for the actions of others involved in the ring. They will also argue that she did not personally benefit from any of the illegal gambling activity.

#  18 People Charged In Alleged Gambling Ring

Authorities have charged 18 people in connection to an alleged gambling ring in upstate New York.

According to prosecutors, the gambling ring was operated out of two businesses in the Rochester area – a sushi restaurant and a karaoke bar. The suspects are accused of accepting bets on professional and college sports games, as well as casino and horse races.

Investigators say they uncovered the operation while investigating an unrelated case. They believe that the ring generated over $1 million in profits over the last two years.

The defendants face various charges, including conspiracy, promoting gambling, and money laundering. If convicted, they could face up to 25 years in prison.

#  Authorities Break Up Gambling Ring Operating Across State Lines

Authorities in three states have announced the dismantling of a large-scale illegal gambling ring that stretched across state lines. The operation, which was headquartered in a small town in eastern Kentucky, generated millions of dollars in revenue each year.

Details of the investigation remain sparse, but authorities say that the ring was run by a small group of men who employed a network of bookmakers and runners to take bets and deliver winnings. The operation is believed to have been operating for several years, with profits reaching into the millions.

In announcing the bust, officials praised the cooperation between law enforcement agencies in Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia. "This is a great example of how law enforcement can work together to protect our citizens," said one official. "We believe that this organization was responsible for bringing crime and corruption to our communities, and we are glad to see it shut down."

No arrests have been made as yet, and authorities say that the investigation is ongoing. They are asking anyone with information about the ring to come forward.

#  Gambling Ring Busted, Many Arrested And Charged

In a major gambling bust, almost two dozen people have been arrested and charged in connection with an illegal gambling ring. The raid netted over $200,000 in cash and numerous gambling machines.

The arrests were the culmination of a months-long investigation by police, who say that the ring was operating out of a number of locations in the city. The suspects are all facing charges of illegal gambling and money laundering.

This is not the first time that such a ring has been busted in the city; in fact, it seems to be becoming something of a regular occurrence. In recent years, there have been several similar raids, all resulting in arrests and charges.

This latest bust is being seen as a major victory by law enforcement officials, who are working hard to crackdown on illegal gambling in the city. They hope that this will send a message to other would-be operators that such activities will not be tolerated.
