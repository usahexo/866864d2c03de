#  Who Owns the Sands Casino in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania?

The Sands Casino in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania is open and running, but who owns it? That answer is not as clear cut as one would think. The casino was originally owned by the Las Vegas Sands Corporation. However, the company ran into some financial difficulties in 2016 and had to sell off a number of its properties, including the Sands Casino in Bethlehem.

In December of 2016, the casino was sold to an investment firm called Wind Creek Hospitality. This company is a subsidiary of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians. The Poarch Band of Creek Indians are a federally recognized tribe of Native Americans who live in Alabama. So, while the Las Vegas Sands Corporation may have built and initially owned the casino, it is now owned by a Native American tribe.

This has caused some controversy, as some people feel that a Native American tribe should not be owning a casino in Pennsylvania. There are also concerns that the tribe will be able to influence the political process in order to get favorable treatment for their casino. So far, however, there has been no evidence that this is actually happening.

In any case, the Sands Casino in Bethlehem is now owned by the Poarch Band of Creek Indians and is running as usual.
