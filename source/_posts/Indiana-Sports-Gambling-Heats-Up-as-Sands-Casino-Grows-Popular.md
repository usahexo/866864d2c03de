# Sports Gambling Increases at Sands Casino as it Becomes More Popular in Indiana

In the gambling industry, when one casino thrives, others tend to suffer. That has not been the case at the Sands Casino Resort in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The casino, which is owned and operated by Las Vegas Sands Corporation (LVS), announced this week that its profits from sports betting are up significantly from last year. In addition, gaming revenue from table games and slots also increased at the Sands Casino Resort in Bethlehem.

The rise in sports gambling can be attributed to a number of factors, including the legalization of sports betting in Pennsylvania in late 2017. Since then, the Sands Casino Resort has become one of the most popular sports betting destinations in the state. In Indiana, where sports gambling is also legal, the Sands Casino Resort is quickly becoming a top choice for bettors as well.

The company’s increasing profits from sports gambling are a direct result of this popularity. “The increase in Sportsbook profit was due to higher bets and win percentages on sporting events” said LVS Chief Financial Officer Robert Gifford. This positive trend is likely to continue as legalized sports betting spreads to additional states across the country.

Legalized sports betting has been a boon for casinos across the United States. In New Jersey, for example, gaming revenue from sports bets totaled $183 million in just six months following legalization. This was a major increase over what was generated from traditional casino games during that time period.

It is clear that legalized sports betting is here to stay, and casinos that embrace it will be successful. The Sands Casino Resort appears to have recognized this early on, and its efforts are now paying off handsomely.
